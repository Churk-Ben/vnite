      "introduction": "宇宙虽有其起源，却没有终结——无限。\n\n星球也有起源，却因其自身之力走向毁灭——有限。\n\n历史上拥有智慧的人类往往是最愚昧的。\n\n生活在海中的鱼不知道陆地的存在，如果它们拥有智慧也会走向毁灭。\n\n人类如果想要超越光速，比鱼类生活在陆地更为滑稽。\n\n这就是，对于反抗神人们的最后通牒。",

At that moment, she received a mail from the enigmatic FB recruiting her to the Rounders, a SERN unit, changing her life forever. As FB often communicated with Moeka and acted as a mother figure towards her, speaking with Moeka about her problems and comforting her, she came to see FB as the person that gave her life meaning and devoted every waking moment to sending mails to them and carrying out their given orders, developing a dependency on FB and their mails. When that relationship which meant life to Moeka required her to kill someone, she killed. By taking another’s life, her life retained meaning. While Moeka is capable of carrying out atrocities for acceptance, she strives to be loved and has the potential to be a good person if led in the right direction.\n/",

Mayuri and Daru refer to him by the nickname Okarin, a portmanteau of his surname and given name. He is the founder of what he calls the \"Future Gadget Laboratory\" in Akihabara where he spends most of his time. Rintarou gives off the appearance of being delusional and paranoid, frequently referring to the \"organization\" that is after him, talking to himself on his phone, and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter. Most of the time he takes on a fairly arrogant personality. He is usually seen wearing a lab coat. As he experiments with time travel, he learns that he is the only one who possesses the ability to determine changes between different timelines, which he dubs \"Reading Steiner\"./ The character is 18 years old and a first year student at Tokyo Denki University.\n\nModified from .",

However, due to the D-Mail, the Rounders were able to approach him and take his IBN 5100, which he had received from Amane Suzuha.\nHis survival led to a world line where Faris is a RaiNetter and Akihabara is still an Electric Town instead of a moe hub./",

She drank several sleeping pills, hoping that she would die, but to no avail. As the pills were not working, her final attempt was to jump off a large building. At that moment, she received a mail from the enigmatic FB recruiting her to the Rounders, a SERN unit, changing her life forever. As FB often communicated with Moeka and acted as a mother figure towards her, speaking with Moeka about her problems and comforting her, she came to see FB as the person that gave her life meaning and devoted every waking moment to sending mails to them and carrying out their given orders, developing a dependency on FB and their mails. When that relationship which meant life to Moeka required her to kill someone, she killed. By taking another’s life, her life retained meaning. While Moeka is capable of carrying out atrocities for acceptance, she strives to be loved and has the potential to be a good person if led in the right direction.\n/",

Okabe often just calls her assistant or one of a number of nicknames he comes up with, such as \"Christina\", \"the Zombie\", and \"Celeb Sev\", none of which she likes. She is considered a tsundere character; she dislikes this characterization as well, strongly objecting whenever Daru mentions it.",

She drank several sleeping pills, hoping that she would die, but to no avail. As the pills were not working, her final attempt was to jump off a large building. At that moment, she received a mail from the enigmatic FB recruiting her to the Rounders, a SERN unit, changing her life forever. As FB often communicated with Moeka and acted as a mother figure towards her, speaking with Moeka about her problems and comforting her, she came to see FB as the person that gave her life meaning and devoted every waking moment to sending mails to them and carrying out their given orders, developing a dependency on FB and their mails. When that relationship which meant life to Moeka required her to kill someone, she killed. By taking another’s life, her life retained meaning. While Moeka is capable of carrying out atrocities for acceptance, she strives to be loved and has the potential to be a good person if led in the right direction.\n/",
